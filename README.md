This is an OAI Harvester library for the arXiv preprint repository, written in Java.  At this point, it is still a work
in progress.

Upon completion, this library will allow its users to query the arXiv OAI repository for items in the "arXivRaw" metadata
format, giving them access to all the metadata of all the articles on the arXiv.
